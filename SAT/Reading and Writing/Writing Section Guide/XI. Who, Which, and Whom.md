*Proper use of "who" and "whom"*: Use "who" to refer to the subject of a sentence and "whom" to refer to the object of a verb or preposition.
- **Example**: Who is the man who fixed my car?
	- Subject of the verb "fixed"
- **Example**: To whom should I address the letter?
	- Object of the preposition "to"

> [!Tip]
>The he/him trick can help determine whether to use "who" or "whom" in a sentence
> 	- If the answer to the question could be "he," then use "who."
> 	- If the answer to the question could be "him," then use "whom."
> 
> 	 Example: To whom should I address the letter?
> 		- Ask the question: Should I address the letter to him> The answer is "Address the letter to him." Therefore, you should use "whom".


*Proper use of "which"*: use "which" to introduce nonrestrictive (nonessential) clauses and "that" to introduce restrictive (essential) clauses.
- **Example**: The car, which is red, belongs to John
	- `Nonrestrictive clause`
	- We can remove "which is red" and the sentence is still complete therefore making "which is red" nonrestrictive
- **Example**: The car that is red belongs to John
	- `Restrictive clause`
	- Can not remove "that is" as it would destroy the sentence structure
