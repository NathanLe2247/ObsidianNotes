*Eliminating Redundancy*: Remove unnecessary repetition in sentences to improve clarity and conciseness.
- **Incorrect Example**: I ran home to Megan. Megan is my sister.
	- `Eliminate the redundancy of saying Megan back to back`
	- **Corrected Example**: I ran home to Megan, my sister.


*Clarity of Pronoun Reference*: Ensure that pronouns have clear and unambiguous antecedents
- **Incorrect Example**: After Sarah told Rachel the bad news, she was very upset.
	- `It's unclear if "she" refers to Sarah or Rachel`
	- **Corrected Example**: After Sarah told Rachel the bad news, Rachel was very upset


*Logical Comparisons*: Make logical and meaningful comparisons in sentences.
- **Correct Example**: Sweden's obesity rate is less than ==that of== the Unites States
	- `Meaningful comparison as comparing statistics of two individual countries.`

> [!NOTE]
> 	- Pay attention to the use of "that of". If we were to say "Sweden's obesity rate is less than the United States" it's not as clear than if we were to say "less than that of the United States". By adding "that of" we know that we are referring to the United States which makes the sentence more clear.
