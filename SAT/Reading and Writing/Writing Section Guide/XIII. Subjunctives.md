Subjunctives are used to express hypothetical or unreal situations, wishes, and recommendations, and emotions. Here is a more detailed explanation of when and how to use subjunctives:

*Use of "were" in hypothetical statements*: In hypothetical or contrary-to-fact situations, use "were" instead of "was" after the pronouns "I," "he/she," and "it."
- **Example**: If ==I were== a bird, I would fly freely in the sky.
- **Example**: She speaks as if ==she were== the queen.


*Use of "were to" for unlikely or hypothetical future events*: To indicate unlikely or hypothetical future events, use the phrase "were to" followed by the base form of the verb. 
- **Example**: If it ==were to== rain tomorrow, we would have to cancel the picnic.
- **Example**: Suppose ==I were== to win the lottery, what would you do?
