*Misplaced Modifiers*: Modifiers should be placed near the words they modify to avoid ambiguity or confusion.
- **Incorrect Example**: I saw a giraffe with binoculars. 
	- `The modifier "with binoculars" should be placed near "I"`
	- **Corrected Example**: With binoculars, I saw a giraffe. 


*Dangling Modifiers*: Modifiers should clearly modify the intended subject or noun
- **Incorrect Example**: After finishing the project, ==the snack== was devoured by John.
	- `The modifier "After finishing the project" should modify who finished the project, that being John, not "the snack"`
	- **Corrected Example**: After finishing the project, John ate a snack. 


*Comparing and Superlative Adjectives*: Adjectives should be used correctly when comparing two or more items.
- **Correct Example**: This book is ==taller== than that one. 
	- `Comparing the height of two books`
- **Correct Example**: She is the smartest student in the class
	- `Comparing the intelligence of students in the class`


*Parallel Comparisons*: Comparisons should be parallel in structure. 
- **Correct Example**: She likes to ==run==, ==swim==, and ==hike==.
	- `Parallel list of activities`


*Double Comparisons*: Avoid using two comparative forms in the same sentence.
- **Incorrect Example**: She is ==more talented== than any other student in the school.
	- **Corrected Example**: she is the most talented student in the school.
	- `Much better, cuts down the wordiness, and because it's a one to many comparison, we'd want to say she's the most talented as it is the most concise.`
