*Subject-Verb Agreement*: The subject and the verb of a sentence must agree in number (singular or plural)
- **Correct Example**: The dog ==barks== loudly.
	- `Subject "dog" is singular, verb "barks" is singular`
> [!TIP]
> Perform the he/they test
> - Incorrect Example: He bark.
> 		`Subject "He" is singular, verb "bark" is plural`
> - Correct Example: They bark.
> 		- `Subject "They" is plural, verb "bark" is plural`


*Indefinite Pronouns*: Indefinite Pronouns take singular verbs (ex: Everyone, Someone, No one) 
- **Correct Example**: Everyone has ==their== own opinion. 
	- `Indefinite pronoun "everyone" is singular, verb "has" is singular'


*Compound Subjects*: When two subjects are joined by "and," they usually take a plural verb
- Correct Example: John and Sarah ==are== going to the party.
	- `Subjects "john" and "Sarah" are plural, verb "are" is plural`


*Collective Nouns*: Collective nouns, representing a group of individuals, can take ether a singular or plural verb, depending on the context. Most commonly, collective nouns take a singular verb.

> [!NOTE]
> > - Collective nouns use a singular verb when the entity acts as a whole, and a plural verb when the individual members act independently

- **Correct Example**: The team ==is== practicing for the game. 
	- `The team collectively is practicing, so the verb "is" is singular`
- **Correct Example**: The team ==are== in disagreement on the course of action. 
	- `The people on the team disagree with each other, so the verb is plural`


*Intervening Phrases*: words or phrases that come between the subject and the verb do not affect the agreement. (Use the he/they test)
- **Correct Example**: The Cat, along with its kittens, ==sits== by the window. 
	- `Subject "cat" is singular, verb "sits" is singular`
