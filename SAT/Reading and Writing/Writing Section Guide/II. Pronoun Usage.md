*Pronoun-Antecedent Agreement*: A pronoun must agree in number and gender with its antecedent.
- **Correct Example**: Sarah lost ==her== keys. 
	- `Feminine pronoun "her" agrees with female antecedent "Sarah"`
- **Correct Example**: The boys finished ==their== homework.
	- `Plural Pronoun "their" agrees with plural antecedent "boys"`


*Ambiguous Pronouns*: Pronouns should have clear antecedents to avoid confusion.
- **Incorrect Example**: Sarah and Lisa went shopping, and ==she== bought a dress.
	- `Pronoun "she" is ambiguous; it's unclear whether it refers to Sarah or Lisa`
- **Correct Example**: Tom saw John and congratulated him. 
	- `Pronoun "him" refers to antecedent "John"`


*Pronoun Case*: Pronouns have different forms depending on their function in the sentence (Subjective, objective, possessive)
- **Correct Example**: ==I== went to the store.
	- `Subject pronoun "I" acts as the subject of the sentence`
- **Correct Example**: She gave him the gift.
	- `Objective pronoun "him" acts as the object of the verb "gave"`


*Pronoun Reference*: Pronouns should refer clearly and unambiguously to their intended antecedents
- **Correct Example**: The man ==who== won the race was happy.
	- `Pronoun who refers to the man who won the race`
- **Correct Example**: The dog that barked is mine. 
	- `Pronoun "That" refers to the dog that barked`
