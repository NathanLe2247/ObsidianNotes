### Single Variable Equations And Quadratics
Just plug them in :D

ex:
![[Single Variable Equation.png]]
Plug in every single answer choice and find out which one doesn't have an answer

### Systems of Equations

Point of intersection is the only point that satisfies both equations

ex:

Equations can be broken down such as how 

10(15x-9) = -15(6-10x) 

was then turned into a systems of equations

y = 10(15x-9)
y = -15(6-10x)

Revealing that it's the same line and therefore infinite solutions. Although, if you were to put it into Desmos as 10(15x-9) = -15(6-10x)  wouldn't reveal a line making you think the answer is supposedly no solution.

> [!Tip]
> No Solution and Infinite Solutions look identical in Desmos if written on one line

### Systems of Inequalities

Desmos will shade inequalities for you

ex: ![[Pasted image 20240815121850.png]]
Any solution that is shaded by both colors is the answer

ex: Question![[Pasted image 20240815122157.png]]

Answer
![[Pasted image 20240815122235.png]]
We're interested in the shaded area that is overlapping and finding the maximum number of bananas, therefore the greatest y value in the shaded area while x is >= 0

### Quadratics with One Solution

ex: Question![[Pasted image 20240815123200.png]]

Answer

> [!TIP]
> y = c will treat c such that it is a constant therefore you must do y = (constant)x + c so that you get the slider 
Then just plug in answer values and find out which one intersects 

### Quadratics with No Solution
Plug into Desmos Calculator and substitute in answer choices for the unknown constant

ex: ![[Pasted image 20240815123531.png]]

> [!TIP]
> If asked for no solution with a system of quadratics USE DESMOS
> If asked for no solution for a system of linear equations DO NOT USE DESMOS


### Mean and Median
You can literally just type in the words and the dataset and it'll return the value

### Random Other Topics

You can create a table in Desmos by clicking on the + in the top left and plugging in your equation for the y
